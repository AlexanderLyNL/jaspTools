# JASPTools
R package which aids developers with writing JASP analyses.

## Installation
It is not necessary to install the package; it comes bundled with the fork from [jasp-desktop](https://github.com/jasp-stats/jasp-desktop/).  
To run it in R, simply attach it by calling:

`library(JASPTools, lib.loc="/%path%/jasp-desktop/Tools/")`

Where `/%path%/` refers to the location of jasp-desktop on your pc.  
For example

`library(JASPTools, lib.loc="/Users/tdjong/JASP/Develop/jasp-desktop/Tools")`

It is important that JASPTools is not installed along with your other packages, as it needs resources from the jasp-desktop environment.

## Functionality
At the moment JASPTools has the following functions:
- `run`: run a JASP analysis
- `view`: view output of a JASP analysis
- `analysisOptions`: create options used by run
- `viewPkgOptions`: views settings in the package
- `setPkgOption`: change a setting in the package

Each of these functions has documentation you may view by the usual syntax, e.g., `?analysisOptions`.

There are two general procedures to running analyses with JASPTools.  
The first procedure uses the .json files to create option lists.  
These lists will almost always require further editing.
### Example 1
```
#create default options
options <- JASPTools::analysisOptions("BinomialTest")

#we want to perform the binomial test on 'contBinom'
options[["variables"]] <- "contBinom"
JASPTools::run("BinomialTest", dataset="debug.csv", options=options)
```

The second procedure uses syntax generated by Qt.  
Just start Qt once, set the options to your liking and copy the syntax from the Qt terminal.
### Example 2
```
#create options from the Qt json string
options <- JASPTools::analysisOptions('{
   "id" : 4,
   "name" : "BinomialTest",
   "options" : {
      "VovkSellkeMPR" : false,
      "confidenceInterval" : false,
      "confidenceIntervalInterval" : 0.950,
      "descriptivesPlots" : false,
      "descriptivesPlotsConfidenceInterval" : 0.950,
      "hypothesis" : "notEqualToTestValue",
      "plotHeight" : 300,
      "plotWidth" : 160,
      "testValue" : 0.50,
      "variables" : [ "contBinom" ]
   },
   "perform" : "run",
   "revision" : 1,
   "settings" : {
      "ppi" : 192
   }
}')
JASPTools::run("BinomialTest", dataset="debug.csv", options=options)
```

It is not necessary to use a JASP dataset (such as the debug.csv file we showed in the examples), you may provide any data.frame to the run function.
