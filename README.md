# JASPTools
R package which aids developers with writing JASP analyses.

## install
It is not necessary to install the package; it comes bundled with jasp-desktop.
You can find it at /jasp-desktop/Tools. To run it in R, simply attach it:

`library(JASPTools, lib.loc="/%path%/jasp-desktop/Tools/")`

It is important that the lib.loc argument points to the Tools directory.

## Todo:
- fix click actions in browser
- see if the unicode to html conversion is possible
- create standard options for each analysis
